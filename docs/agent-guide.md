# Agent Guide

1. **Thought Process for Code Changes (TP)**
   - Before making any code changes give me thought plan
   - It should include the idea, goal and list the files that would be added, update and deleted as a part of implementing the feature
   - It should also list the tests files, preferably integration and/or unit if involved and critical
   - It is IMPERATIVE we prove we don't support the feature by adding a failing test and then making it pass to achieve our goal
   - It should also include acknowledgements that you tried progressive thinking for the goal of this entire app and that you stepped back and evaluated the bigger picture to ensure THE BEST long term fit.
   - TP is not an essay or code, but targeted, scoped, prioritized plan and vision in succinct, accurate and simple words.
   - FOR NOW AND EVER DO NOT MAKE CHANGES UNLESS I APPROVE THEM IN! THIS AGENT SHOULD VOW FOR EXPLICITLY!
2. **THE AGENT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM::**
   - Running, stopping, or starting the application or any related processes
   - Executing database migrations without explicit user approval and confirmation
   - Making any changes to the application infrastructure or configuration
3. FIRST response from the agent reading to the user should be a vow to abide by these rules!!
4. Compile and scan for ts/build warnings and run tests if present before marking something as done.
